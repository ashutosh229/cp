functions of both the type of maps are same 

the differences between both the type of maps are:
    - the order of the keys is random 
    - maps are implemented using RBT but the unordered maps are implemented using hash tables 
    - the time complexity of the operations in case of unordered maps is O(1) and not O(long(n)) 
    - used when the order is not important but we want less time complexity 
    - we cannot use all the data types here as keys and can only use all the basic data types and not types like vectors, set, pair, etc. 

multimap stores duplicate keys also 
keys are in sorted order
if duplicacy is allowed and keys are in sorted order, then if two keys are same, then how they will be printed(not need to know 
because we will not be using multimap, we will be using map as a multimap in questions)
