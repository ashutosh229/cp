the all the functions of sets can be used in unordered sets 

the differences between both the type of sets:
- time complexity of the operation is O(1) 
- the order is random and not sorted 
- we cannot keep the type of the element as a non-primitive data type like vector or pair 
- sets are implemented using RBT but unordered sets are implemented using hash tables 

multiset allows us to store multiple or duplicate elements in the set 
the time complexity of the operations in case of multiset is O(logn)
s.find() for multiset returns the iterator of the first element 
s.erase("abc") erases all the elements in the multiset 
s.erase(it) erases only the element to which the it is pointing
