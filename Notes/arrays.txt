concept of arrays:
segmentation fault: when oob index is accessed 
character arrays should not be used, always use strings 
matrix concept: a[4][3][2][2] 
local array size: order of 10 power 5
global array size: order of 10 power 7
global array size should be declared as a constant 

pass by value(int n)
pass by reference(int &n)
arrays are passed by reference by default
strings are passed by value by default 
when passing 1D arrays in functions, we can or not enter the size with the array i.e. (int a[n]) or (int a[], int n)
when passing 2D arrays in functions, we have to pass the dimension after the 1st dimension i.e. (int a[][2][3], int n) or (int a[4][2][3])

while passing arrays in functions, we never pass them from the main to the function 
we make the global array and pass them:
const int max_size = 1e5+10;
int a[max_size]
void access(){
a[0] = 1;
}
