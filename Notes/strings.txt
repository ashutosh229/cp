getline(cin,str1);
cursor movements in case of cin and cout and getline;
cin.ignore();

str.push_back(c)(time complexity is constant);
str = str + char;(time complexity depends on the size of the string)
therefore, push_back function is better 

dealing with large numbers:
take the number in the input as string 
when you need to perform operations, convert into number (not possible via functions, have to do manually)
int value_index = (int)str[index] - '0' (method to convert)
