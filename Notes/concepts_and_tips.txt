inbuilt functions:
swap(a,b);
max(a,b);
min(a,b);
__gcd(a,b);
minmax_element(arr, arr + n) {returns reference, so need to *}



concepts:
breaking the string into space separated words (using cin)
converting the lowercase into uppercase(small - a = big - A)(distance between character)
binary strings
gcd with 0 is the number itself 
gcd of three numbers is the gcd of two and then the gcd of the answer with third 
gcd of array 
is palindrome(mirror image concept)
can palindrome pe possible by rearranging (use the concept of "(one odd and others even) or (none odd)")
