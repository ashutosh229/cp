some important facts:
- not(complement) operator is ~ and not !
- even number has last bit 0 
- odd number has last bit 1 
- n bits i.e. 2 power n total numbers possible
- n bits i.e. max number possible = pow(2,n) - 1;
- pow(2,n) = 1<<n //useful when it comes to finding the power of 2
- LSB: rightmost bit or 0th index bit 
- MSB: leftmost bit or nth index bit
- bit is set i.e. bit is 1 
- bit is unset i.e. bit is 0 
- finding ith bit can be done by either trick 1 or right shift transformation
- counting the number of set bits can be done in two ways:
    - use the loop and count
    - use the builtin function to get the direct count
- counting the number of unset bits can be done via (total_bits-set_bits)
- how to count? counter = counter + ith_bit where ith_bit can be found by either of the two ways
- 

important questions:
- how to find whether a bit is set or unset ? (use the trick 1)
- how to find LSB ? (use trick 1)
- how to find MSB ? (use trick 1)
- how to find any ith bit ? (use trick 1)
- how to find the even or odd number ? (use trick 1)
[all the above 5 questions are actually the same thing i.e. finding the ith bit somehow]
[since its about finding the ith bit, we can also use the right shift transformation]
- how to set a bit? (use trick 1)
- how to unset a bit? (use trick 1)
- how to toggle the bit? (use trick 1)
[all the above 3 questions are nearly the same thing i.e. changing the bit using trick 1]
- how to find the large powers of two ? (use the 1<<n formula)
- how to calculate the number after being overflowed? (see the reference of 1<<32)
- 


important transformations:
- getting the ith bit as 1 and rest as 0: (1<<i)
- getting the first i bits as 1 and rest as 0: (1<<i) - 1 
- getting the ith bit a 0 and rest as 1: !(1<<i)
- getting the first i bits as 0 and rest as 1: !((1<<i)-1)
- getting all the bits as 0: take 0 
- getting all the bits as 1: (1<<i) or (!(1<<i))
- getting the ith bit in the LSB and all others as 0: (n>>i) (important because bit==number then, also called the right shift transformation)
- 

important operators:
- and 
- or 
- xor (same mein 0 and different mein 1)
- not 
- left shift: << (padding kardo 0 ze)
- right shift: >> (gayab kardo shifted bits)

memory representation of numbers:
- integer: 32 bits 
- 

signed and unsigned integers:


table for shortcuts:
1:
    - and: num 
    - or: 1
    - xor: !num
    - not: 0
    - left shift: if done n times, then answer is pow(2,n)
    - right shift: 0
0:
    - and: 0 
    - or: num
    - xor: num 
    - not: 1 
    - left shift: 0 
    - right shift: 0

awesome tricks: (reduced from the table of shortcuts)
1. 
number diya hain 
kya operation lagega woh find karo
kis number ke sath lagega woh find karo (kaise find karein?)
operation karo 
ek number aya 
us number ko check karo: (kya condition lagegi)
    - if (condition(number)==true){do something} (kya karenge)
    - else {do something}

in the above trick:
- how to find the operation and the number? i.e. use karo table ko and dimag ko (use constant and func rule two times, one 
for 0 and another for 1 and get two methods for solving the problem)
- how to find the condition applied? i.e. question pe depend karta hain 
- how to find what to do? i.e. question mein diya huya hoga 

2. 
subtracting one from a number:  
adding one to a number
multiplication of a number by one 
division of a number by one 

subtracting zero from a number 
adding zero to a number 
multiplication of zero to a number 
dividing number by zero
