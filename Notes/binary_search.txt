monotonic functions:
-which follows some given order 
-increasing 
-decreasing 
-predicate with initial false and then true 
-predicate with initial true and then false 

binary search:
-only works on monotonic functions 
-logn time complexity due to half reduction of search space

applications:
lower bound
upper_bound
